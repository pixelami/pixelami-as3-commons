Pixelami Actionscript Commons

Including:

pixelami-amf-lib - An Actionscript 3 library to serialize objects to a from AS3
pixelami-runner-lib - A Actionscript 3 library to queue and run methods across multiple frames if necessary



Pixelami AMF Library (pixelami-amf-lib)
An Actionscript 3 library for serializing objects to and from AMF3 

The initial purpose is to allow strongly typed objects to be generated via AMF3 for testing mid-tier/backend services.

The deserializer will be used to create an asynchronous AM3 deserializer



Pixelami Runner Library (pixelami-runner-lib)
An Actionscript 3 library for queueing and running methods in the background

e.g.
import org.pixelami.runner.run

run(myMethod)

run(myMethod,[myArg0])

run(myMethod,[myArg0,myArg1,myArg2])

run(myMethod,[myArg0,myArg1,myArg2],scope)


Below the hood
______________

Functions are queued in a single stack.

A single enterFrame handler shifts methods off the stack and passes an optional array of arguments 
and optional scope argument to the apply() method of each Function.

The Runner attempts to throttle how many methods get called per frame, thereby allowing the developer to 
spread heavy processing tasks across several frames rather than grinding the frame rate to a halt 
and blocking display updates.

Well that's the theory at least.


How to
______

How to know when a particular batch of methods have completed ?

The runner does not fire events - but you can add a final method to the runner the can fire an event or call a callback
eg.
run(function():void{dispatchEvent(new Event("complete"))},null,this);
